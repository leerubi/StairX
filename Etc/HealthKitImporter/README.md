# HealthKit Importer

With this Swift 4 project you can import HK data from a device to your simulator/another device.

To get HK data you can use the default data file in the project or just get one from your device:

HealthKit App -> User icon -> Export health data -> 
extract the export.xml file form the zip and replace the exisating one in the project.

* Not all HK record types were added to this importer, feel free to add more of the missing types
