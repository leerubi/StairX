let rect1 = Rectangle(height: 7, width: 5)
let rect2 = Rectangle(height: 5, width: 7)

Exercise 1 would evaluate to true. The variable description is identical to the string we evaluate against.

Exercise 2 would also evaluate to true; the number 1 is the same regardless of whether it's represented as a float or an integer.

Exercise 3 would evaluate to false. The constants rect1 and rect2 contain different values for height and width.

let arrayOfInts = [10,8,9]
let biggerArrayOfInts = [6,5,4,3]

let arraySizeBool = arrayOfInts.count < biggerArrayOfInts.count

let anotherAlphabeticalBool = "xerox" > "xylophone"

var age = 29
let applySeniorDiscount = age >= 65

Exercise 1 would evaluate to true; arrayOfInts has three elements while biggerArrayOfInts has four elements. Three is, in fact, less than four.

Exercise 2 would evaluate to false. "xerox" would come before "xylophone" in the dictionary, making it "less than" xylophone.

Exercise 3 would also evaluate to false. A 29-year-old still has a ways to go before qualifying for a senior discount at age 65!

There are some special terms here that require special attention. When we look at the definition of a function like sayHelloToStudent(student: String), any input values that are specified are called parameters. Then, when we actually call a function, as in sayHelloToStudent(student: jarrod) the input values that are passed to the function are known as arguments.
